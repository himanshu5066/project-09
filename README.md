 How It Works
User Input: A query is entered via the Streamlit interface.

News Retrieval: NewsAPI fetches the most relevant articles.

Summarization:
Descriptions are extracted from each article.
A LangChain LLMChain with a prompt template sends them to OpenAI for summarization.
Result Display: Final summary is rendered on the Streamlit app.

 Testing & Validation
 Confirmed basic functionality of query and summary flow.
 Validated quality and relevance of AI-generated summaries.

 Optional Enhancements
 User Authentication
 Improved UI/UX with advanced Streamlit components
